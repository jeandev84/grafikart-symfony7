# Security 


1. Make User 
```bash
php bin/console make:user


 The name of the security user class (e.g. User) [User]:
 > 

 Do you want to store user data in the database (via Doctrine)? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

 Enter a property name that will be the unique "display" name for the user (e.g. email, username, uuid) [email]:
 > username

 Will this app need to hash/check user passwords? Choose No if passwords are not needed or will be checked/hashed by some other system (e.g. a single sign-on server).

 Does this app need to hash/check user passwords? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

 created: src/Entity/User.php
 created: src/Repository/UserRepository.php
 updated: src/Entity/User.php
 updated: config/packages/security.yaml

           
  Success! 
           

 Next Steps:
   - Review your new App\Entity\User class.
   - Use make:entity to add more fields to your User entity and then run make:migration.
   - Create a way to authenticate! See https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html
 
```


2. Make Auth 
```bash 
php bin/console make:auth
What style of authentication do you want? [Empty authenticator]:
[0] Empty authenticator
[1] Login form authenticator
> 1

The class name of the authenticator to create (e.g. AppCustomAuthenticator):
> AppAuthenticator

Choose a name for the controller class (e.g. SecurityController) [SecurityController]:
> 

Do you want to generate a '/logout' URL? (yes/no) [yes]:
> 

Do you want to support remember me? (yes/no) [yes]:
> 

How should remember me be activated? [Activate when the user checks a box]:
[0] Activate when the user checks a box
[1] Always activate remember me
> 

created: src/Security/AppAuthenticator.php
updated: config/packages/security.yaml
created: src/Controller/SecurityController.php
created: templates/security/login.html.twig

       
Success! 
       

Next:
- Customize your new authenticator.
- Finish the redirect "TODO" in the App\Security\AppAuthenticator::onAuthenticationSuccess() method.
- Review & adapt the login template: templates/security/login.html.twig.
```


3. Add Fields 
```bash 
bin/console make:entity User
Your entity already exists! So let's add some new fields!

New property name (press <return> to stop adding fields):
> email

Field type (enter ? to see all types) [string]:
> 

Field length [255]:
> 

Can this field be null in the database (nullable) (yes/no) [no]:
> 

updated: src/Entity/User.php

Add another property? Enter the property name (or press <return> to stop adding fields):
> 


       
Success! 
       

Next: When you're ready, create a migration with php bin/console make:migration

created: migrations/Version20240317192309.php

       
Success! 
       

Review the new migration then run it with php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

WARNING! You are about to execute a migration in database "symfony_recipes" that could result in schema changes and data loss. Are you sure you wish to continue? (yes/no) [yes]:
>

```


4. Make Registration form 
```bash 
php bin/console make:registration-form
 Creating a registration form for App\Entity\User

 Do you want to add a #[UniqueEntity] validation attribute to your User class to make sure duplicate accounts aren't created? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

 Do you want to send an email to verify the user's email address after registration? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

                                                                                                                        
 [WARNING] We're missing some important components. Don't forget to install these after you're finished.                
                                                                                                                        
           composer require symfonycasts/verify-email-bundle                                                            
                                                                                                                        

 By default, users are required to be authenticated when they click the verification link that is emailed to them.
 This prevents the user from registering on their laptop, then clicking the link on their phone, without
 having to log in. To allow multi device email verification, we can embed a user id in the verification link.

 Would you like to include the user id in the verification link to allow anonymous email verification? (yes/no) [no]:
 > 

 What email address will be used to send registration confirmations? (e.g. mailer@your-domain.com):
 > support@demo.fr

 What "name" should be associated with that email address? (e.g. Acme Mail Bot):
 > Support

 Do you want to automatically authenticate the user after registration? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

 updated: src/Entity/User.php
 updated: src/Entity/User.php
 created: src/Security/EmailVerifier.php
 created: templates/registration/confirmation_email.html.twig
 created: src/Form/RegistrationFormType.php
 created: src/Controller/RegistrationController.php
 created: templates/registration/register.html.twig

           
  Success! 
           

 Next:
 1) Install some missing packages:
      composer require symfonycasts/verify-email-bundle
 2) In RegistrationController::verifyUserEmail():
    * Customize the last redirectToRoute() after a successful email verification.
    * Make sure you're rendering success flash messages or change the $this->addFlash() line.
 3) Review and customize the form, controller, and templates as needed.
 4) Run "php bin/console make:migration" to generate a migration for the newly added User::isVerified property.

 Then open your browser, go to "/register" and enjoy your new form!
