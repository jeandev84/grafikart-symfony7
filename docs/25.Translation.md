3. Translate via locale user 
```bash 
php bin/console make:entity User

Your entity already exists! So let's add some new fields!

New property name (press <return> to stop adding fields):
> locale

Field type (enter ? to see all types) [string]:
> 

Field length [255]:
> 

Can this field be null in the database (nullable) (yes/no) [no]:
> 

updated: src/Entity/User.php

Add another property? Enter the property name (or press <return> to stop adding fields):
> 


       
Success! 
       

Next: When you're ready, create a migration with php bin/console make:migration
created: migrations/Version20240318222245.php

       
Success! 
       

Review the new migration then run it with php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

5. Doctrine extensions bundles 
- Loading all extensions if you want ```composer require gedmo/doctrine-extensions```
- stof/doctrine-extensions-bundle
- https://symfony.com/bundles/StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle/current/index.html
- https://github.com/stof/StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle
- https://github.com/doctrine-extensions/DoctrineExtensions

That is the specific command you need for our case:
- https://symfony.com/bundles/StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle/current/installation.html
```bash
composer require stof/doctrine-extensions-bundle:*

https://symfony.com/bundles/StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle/current/configuration.html#add-the-extensions-to-your-mapping

add config to config/packages/doctrine.yaml

mappings:
    App:
       ...
    gedmo_translatable:
        type: attribute
        prefix: Gedmo\Translatable\Entity
        dir: "%kernel.project_dir%/vendor/gedmo/doctrine-extensions/src/Translatable/Entity"
        alias: GedmoTranslatable # (optional) it will default to the name set for the mapping
        is_bundle: false
                

add config to config/packages/stof_doctrine_extensions.yaml
stof_doctrine_extensions:
    default_locale: fr
    # app/config/config.yml
    # (or config/packages/stof_doctrine_extensions.yaml if you use Flex)
    orm:
        default:
            translatable: true

```


6. Add Attribute ```Translatable```
```php 
<?php
namespace App\Entity;

use Gedmo\Mapping\Annotation\Translatable;

...
class Recipe
{
    ...
    
    #[Translatable]
    private string $title = '';

    ...
}

php bin/console make:migration
```
